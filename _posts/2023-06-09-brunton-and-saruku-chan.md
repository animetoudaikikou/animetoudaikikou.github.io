You're probably familiar with Japan's obsession with mascots. Like many prefectures across Japan, Nagasaki's tourism board has their own: Saruku-chan (さるくちゃん, if you squint you can see the sa-ru-ku in the face-design). Saruku-chan, however, is unlike most mascots in that it has an interesting, and tangentially anime-related, connection to Japan's lighthouses.

One of Saruku-chan's jobs is to feature on information signage. Some of the signs are manhole-sized discs, embedded in the ground on routes with destinations of cultural interest. The presence of QR codes encourages photographing them.

As everybody knows, the hottest cultural property in any area lucky enough to have one is a historic lighthouse. Nagasaki prefecture is no exception, and its tourism board have duly set a route that includes [Iojima](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iojimazaki_Lighthouse){:target="_blank"}, a lighthouse designed by Brunton with construction starting 1869. It’s apparently also the lighthouse that [features](https://files.catbox.moe/24ihqf.jpg){:target="_blank"} in the anime series [_IRODUKU: The World in Colors_](https://anilist.co/anime/101316/Irozuku-Sekai-no-Ashita-kara){:target="_blank"} (see, I told you that this was tangentially anime-related). 

However, the best thing about the route is that, on one of the information discs, Saruku-chan appears next to Iojima lighthouse in the guise of the big man himself, the "Father of Japanese lighthouses": Richard Henry Brunton. (See also: my [introduction post](/Japans-Lighthouses){:target="_blank"} about Brunton.)

They wrote "Henly" instead of "Henry" (probably better than "Blanton" instead of "Brunton", which seems to be a more common English-to-Katakana-to-Romaji translation error). Nonetheless, it's a nice, unique memorial for a man who was, through his work in Japan, partly responsible for the saving of countless lives and yet is largely forgotten, at least here in his home country. 

Whether or not this is the first and only instance of a Richard Henry Brunton cosplay, I cannot state conclusively. I will, however, hazard a guess that this is only time a Japanese prefectural mascot has appeared dressed as a 19th-century Scottish lighthouse engineer.
