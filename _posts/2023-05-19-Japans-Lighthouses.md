The depiction of real lighthouses in the second season of <i>Yuru Camp</i> prompted me to look up Japan's history with lighthouses. I thought that the ones shown in the second episode looked remarkably similar to the nineteenth-century brick and stone lighthouses that you can see around the UK. It turns out that's because modern lighthouse construction in Japan was kick-started in the 1870s thanks to the work of a Scottish engineer called Richard Henry Brunton, apparently remembered in Japan as the "Father of Japanese lighthouses". 

Brunton was employed by the Japanese government of the time as part of an agreement between Japan and the UK (as well as other western powers) to make the Japanese coastline safer for international commercial shipping. While Japan apparently had a long history of light signals in dangerous coastal areas before Brunton's arrival, these were [traditional-style buildings](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E4%B8%8A%E6%9C%89%E7%9F%A5%E6%B9%8A) without the innovations that had been pioneered recently in the [UK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddystone_Lighthouse#Smeaton's_lighthouse) and [France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fresnel_lens).

_Brunton's Shiriyazaki Lighthouse is still the tallest brick lighthouse in Japan and is located at the northeasternmost point of Honshu. It's one of 23 lighthouses ranked "A" by the Japanese Maritime Safety Agency for their historic and cultural value. It was also the first lighthouse in Japan to install a fogbell and, later, a foghorn._

Brunton designed and oversaw the construction of at least 26 lighthouses during his time in Japan from 1868 to 1876. This historical curiosity explains why the lighthouses depicted in _Yuru Camp_, as well as in other anime and manga, wouldn’t look out of place on the coasts of Britain or North America. There’s a memorial bust of Brunton in Yokohama Park, erected to recognise the civil work he did in the city alongside his work on lighthouses all along Japan's coastline.
