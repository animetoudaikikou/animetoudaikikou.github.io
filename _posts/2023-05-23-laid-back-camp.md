__Anime__: _Laid Back Camp_ (ゆるキャン△) - Season 2 (2021)<br />
__Location__: Shizuoka Prefecture (静岡県)<br />
__Lighthouses__: [Omaesaki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omaesaki_Lighthouse){:target="_blank"} ([御前埼灯台](https://lighthouse-japan.com/shizuoka/omaesaki/omaesaki.html){:target="_blank"}), Kaketsuka ([掛塚灯台](https://lighthouse-japan.com/shizuoka/kakezuka/kakezuka.html){:target="_blank"}), Tsumekizaki ([爪木埼灯台](https://lighthouse-japan.com/shizuoka/tsumekisaki/tsumekisaki.html){:target="_blank"}), Heda ([戸田灯台](https://lighthouse-japan.com/shizuoka/heda/heda.html){:target="_blank"})
<br />
<br />
_Laid Back Camp_ season 2 features no less than four different lighthouses, all taken from real locations in Shizuoka Prefecture. The first, pictured above, is Omaesaki lighthouse [[Google Maps location](https://goo.gl/maps/ddzEosFCjFHm96Wj7){:target="_blank"}]. Omaesaki is relatively well-known as one of the lighthouses built by [Richard Henry Brunton](/Japans-Lighthouses){:target="_blank"} in the 1870s.

<br />
The second lighthouse, pictured below, is Kaketsuka [[Google Maps location](https://goo.gl/maps/ghp5DE6Lg89fUssm8){:target="_blank"}]. As far as I can tell, this is not a Brunton lighthouse. However, it does originally date from the same period, with construction finishing in 1897 (one year after Brunton left Japan). The lighthouse was moved to its current location in 2002 to prevent it from falling victim to coastal erosion.

The third lighthouse, below, is Tsumekizaki [[Google Maps location](https://goo.gl/maps/vxzLN2pHamU2kJLi8){:target="_blank"}]. This lighthouse is a bit newer (first lit in 1937), but has all the charm of the more historic lighthouses.

The final one, Heda lighthouse on Mihamazaki [[Google Maps location](https://goo.gl/maps/P2gic4nwpZVcn6Le9){:target="_blank"}], is rather interesting.

We only catch a distant glimpse of it in the episode, but this modern lighthouse is notable for its photo opportunies including Mt. Fuji.

<i>Laid Back Camp</i> is known for its depiction of real locations around Japan and this season ended up being a treat for spotting lighthouses.
