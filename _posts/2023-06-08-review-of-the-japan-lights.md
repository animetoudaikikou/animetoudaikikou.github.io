_The Japan Lights_ follows author Iain Maloney, a Scottish expat settled in Japan, on his trips around the country to visit the 26 remaining lighthouses that were designed and built in the late 19th Century by the Scottish engineer Richard Henry Brunton, the "Father of Japanese Lighthouses". 

The book’s chapters alternate between a travelogue of these trips around Japan and the story of Brunton's life and work in Meiji-era Japan. 

The biggest strength of the book is in its treatment of Brunton the man. Maloney has clearly done his research, reading Brunton’s own words and consulting archive materials, but he wears this knowledge lightly. The result is a detailed but accessible biography that attempts to get at the character of a man primarily only remembered for his engineering achievements. In this attempt, Maloney takes a modern and critical approach, recognising how the strength of Brunton’s character allowed him to achieve what did, while also acknowledging his many unpalatable aspects. Maloney’s treatment of historical events also reflects this attitude, with no punches pulled in regard to both Japan and the West’s behaviour from the 19th Century to the present day. 

This balanced tone continues in the more personal, travel-based chapters. On his travels, Maloney uses his perspective as an outsider to reflect on a broad range of topics, from the WWII bombings and the 2011 tsunami to the friendships built and lost as a foreign resident of Japan. While many of these personal tangents serve as a connection to Brunton’s status as a foreigner in 19th-century Japan, they’re interesting enough in their own right and provide an intimate look at the author himself. 

I’ve hardly mentioned lighthouses so far in this review, and that fact points to where this book is weakest. Maloney isn’t an expert, or even a lighthouse enthusiast. His primary interest is in how a Scotsman ~150 years ago came to be recognised as the “Father of Japanese Lighthouses”, not in the buildings themselves. The result is that the chapters related to Maloney's lighthouse visits usually end up brief, sometimes with only a short paragraph dedicated to details about the lighthouse in question. It’s fair enough that there’s only so many times you can say “it’s a white building with a light on the top”, but a writer with a more general interest in lighthouses may have been able to make more of the travelogue aspect of the book. Separating the historical and personal chapters only highlights this limitation and, as such, the book fails to present a smooth, integrated story to compare with the very best creative non-fiction. 

Regardless of that limitation, this is still a thoroughly entertaining and enlightening book. In fact, depending on the direction from which you're approaching the book, it may not even seem like a limitation. (I understand that not everybody is interested in obscure technical details about lighthouses. Although I can't understand _why_ that is.) I would certainly recommend it if you are interested in the Meiji period and modern Japanese history, the experience of contemporary foreign residents in Japan or, of course, lighthouses.
