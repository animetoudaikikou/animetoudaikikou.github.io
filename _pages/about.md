「アニメ灯台紀行」 ("*anime toudai kikou*") is a rough, Japanese translation of "anime lighthouse travelogue".

The blog documents lighthouses that have featured in anime and manga, alongside more general English-language posts about Japanese lighthouses. Head to the [Index](/index/){:target="_blank"} page for alphabetically ordered lists of anime and lighthouses.

The idea for the blog was born from the simple fact of seeing western-style lighthouses in anime. I've long had a casual interest in lighthouses, visiting them here in the UK whenever the opportunity arose as well as picking up bits and pieces about their history. The familiar-looking designs of the real lighthouses featured in [*Laid Back Camp*](/laid-back-camp/){:target="_blank"} sent me on a hunt for information about [Japan's history with lighthouses](https://animetoudaikikou.github.io/Japans-Lighthouses/){:target="_blank"}. Since then, I've fallen further and further down the rabbit hole, gathering English-language information about Japan's lighthouses and logging every anime lighthouse, both real and fictional, that I've spotted. The blog will hopefully act as a journal of sorts, allowing me to collate and organise all this niche information.

The name of the blog was inspired by the title of my favourite manga, <i>Yokohama Kaidashi Kikou</i>, and the book [ニッポン灯台紀行](https://www.amazon.co.jp/%E3%83%8B%E3%83%83%E3%83%9D%E3%83%B3%E7%81%AF%E5%8F%B0%E7%B4%80%E8%A1%8C-%E5%B2%A1-%E5%85%8B%E5%B7%B1/dp/4418152148){:target="_blank"} (<i>Nippon Toudai Kikou</i>).
