「アニメ灯台紀行」 ("*anime toudai kikou*" in wapuro romaji) is a rough, Japanese translation of "anime lighthouse travelogue".

The blog documents lighthouses in anime and manga, alongside more general English-language posts about Japanese lighthouses.

<br />
The idea for the blog was born from the simple fact of seeing western-style lighthouses in anime. I've long had a casual interest in lighthouses, visiting them here in the UK whenever the opportunity arose. The familiar-looking designs of the lighthouses featured in *Yuru Camp* sent me on a hunt for information about [Japan's history with lighthouses](https://animetoudaikikou.github.io/Japans-Lighthouses/). Since then, I've been logging every anime lighthouse, both real and fictional, that I've spotted.

The name for the blog is inspired by my favourite manga, <i>Yokohama Kaidashi Kikou</i> ("Yokohama Shopping Log"), and the book [ニッポン灯台紀行](https://www.amazon.co.jp/%E3%83%8B%E3%83%83%E3%83%9D%E3%83%B3%E7%81%AF%E5%8F%B0%E7%B4%80%E8%A1%8C-%E5%B2%A1-%E5%85%8B%E5%B7%B1/dp/4418152148) (<i>Nippon Toudai Kikou</i>, "Japan Lighthouse Travelogue").
