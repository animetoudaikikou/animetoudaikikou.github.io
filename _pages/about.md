「アニメ灯台紀行」 ("*anime toudai kikou*" in wapuro romaji) is a rough, Japanese translation of "anime lighthouse travelogue".

The blog documents lighthouses in anime and manga, alongside more general English-language posts about Japanese lighthouses.
<br />
<br />
The idea for the blog was born from the simple fact of seeing western-style lighthouses in anime. I've long had a casual interest in lighthouses, visiting them in my own country whenever the opportunity arose, and the familiar-looking designs of the lighthouses featured in *Yuru Camp* sent me on a hunt for information about [Japan's history with lighthouses](https://animetoudaikikou.github.io/Japans-Lighthouses/). Since then, I've been logging every anime lighthouse, both real and fictional, that I've spotted.

The website is hosted on Github and uses a slightly modified version of [Reverie Light](https://github.com/confor/reverie-light).
