## Naming Conventions
I follow Anilist's convention of using the English title for anime and manga that have received an official English translation. Otherwise, I use the most common romaji title.

For locations and lighthouses, I use the most common romaji name. This sometimes results in inconsistencies (e.g. both -zaki and -saki endings appear on lighthouse names that include the kanji for "cape" or "headland", 埼). I also include the original Japanese name in the relevant post whenever possible.
